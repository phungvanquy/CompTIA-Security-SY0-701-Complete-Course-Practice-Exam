## Updates & Patches – Exam Summary

Updates and patches are a **core part of system hardening**. One of the most effective ways to secure workstations, servers, and cloud systems is by having a **strong patch management program**.

---

## 1. What Are Patches and Why They Matter

* Software developers release **patches** to fix bugs and security flaws.
* Patches apply to:

  * Operating systems
  * Applications
  * Firmware
  * Cloud instances
* Many real-world breaches happen simply because **systems were missing patches**.

**Key risk:**
Attackers often **reverse-engineer patches shortly after release** to discover vulnerabilities. If you delay patching, your systems become easy targets.

## 2. Patch Management

**Patch management** is the process of:

* Scanning systems for vulnerabilities
* Applying patches to prevent exploitation

### Patch Management Methods

* **Manual** – Rare and inefficient today
* **Automated** – Most common and preferred
* **Hybrid** – Automated for most systems, manual for high-value or sensitive systems

Automation ensures:

* Consistency
* Coverage (even during weekends or holidays)
* Reduced human error

## 3. Types of Software Releases (Very Important for Exams)

### Hotfix

* Fixes a **security vulnerability**
* Must be applied **immediately** after testing
* High priority
* Prevents active exploitation

👉 *Exam tip:* Hotfix = **security + urgency**

---

### Update

* Adds **new features or functionality**
* Usually **not security-related**
* Can introduce **new vulnerabilities**

👉 *Exam tip:* Updates ≠ security fixes

---

### Service Pack

* Bundle of **many hotfixes and updates**
* Single installer
* Saves time during system setup or recovery

👉 *Exam tip:* Service pack = **collection of patches**

## 4. Elements of an Effective Patch Management Program

An organization should have:

1. **Assigned responsibility**

   * A person or team tracks vendor patch bulletins

2. **Patch deployment mechanism**

   * Preferably automated
   * Covers OS and applications

3. **Cloud patching coverage**

   * Cloud systems must be included

4. **Patch prioritization**

   * Urgent
   * Important
   * Non-critical

5. **Test/Lab environment**

   * Test urgent and important patches before production

6. **Logging and documentation**

   * Track patch deployments
   * Monitor effectiveness

7. **Firmware update process**

   * Firmware must also be evaluated and patched

8. **Emergency patch process**

   * Approved by an Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB)
   * Allows rapid deployment of critical hotfixes

9. **Scheduled non-critical rollouts**

   * Example: bi-weekly combined deployment

## 5. Key Exam Takeaways (Memory Friendly)

* **Patch management reduces attack risk**
* **Hotfix = security + immediate**
* **Update = new features, not security**
* **Service pack = bundled patches**
* **Automation is preferred**
* **Test before production**
* **Attackers move fast—patching must be faster**
