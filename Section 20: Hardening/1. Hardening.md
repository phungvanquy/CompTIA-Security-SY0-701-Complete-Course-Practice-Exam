# Hardening – Exam Preparation Summary

## What Is Hardening?

**Hardening** is the process of **reducing security risk** by minimizing vulnerabilities in a **system, application, or network**.

Hardening typically includes:

* Applying patches and updates
* Changing insecure default settings
* Restricting access and applications
* Disabling unnecessary services
* Enforcing secure configurations

**Goal:** Reduce the attack surface and improve resilience against attacks.

---

## Exam Domains Covered

* **Objective 2.5:** Explain mitigation techniques used to secure the enterprise
* **Objective 4.1:** Apply common security techniques to computing resources
* **Objective 4.5:** Modify enterprise capabilities to enhance security

---

## 1. Default Configurations

**Default settings are often insecure and must be changed.**

Common defaults to fix:

* Default passwords
* Default open ports
* Default protocols and services
* Insecure vendor configurations

**Why it matters:**
Attackers often exploit known default settings.

---

## 2. Application Restriction (Allow Listing)

**Only approved applications are allowed to run.**

* Everything else is blocked by default
* Prevents malware and unauthorized software
* Strong proactive security control

**Key idea:**
Allow listing = *deny by default*

---

## 3. Disabling Unnecessary Services

**Remove anything not required for business operations.**

Unnecessary services:

* Consume system resources
* Increase the attack surface
* Introduce avoidable vulnerabilities

**Best practice:**
If you don’t need it → disable or remove it.

---

## 4. Trusted Operating Systems

**Operating systems designed and certified for high security.**

Characteristics:

* Strong access controls
* Designed for sensitive or classified data
* Evaluated against strict security standards

**Used when:**
High assurance and trustworthiness are required.

---

## 5. Updates and Patches

### Updates

* Improve features
* Fix bugs
* Enhance performance and security

### Patches

* Specifically fix **known vulnerabilities**
* Often security-focused

**Exam tip:**
All patches are updates, but not all updates are patches.

---

## 6. Patch Management

**The structured process of keeping systems up to date.**

Includes:

1. Identifying patches
2. Testing patches
3. Deploying patches
4. Monitoring results

**Why it matters:**
Unpatched systems are one of the **most common attack vectors**.

---

## 7. Group Policy (Windows Environments)

**Centralized management of user and computer settings.**

Used to:

* Enforce security standards
* Control passwords, updates, permissions
* Ensure compliance across the enterprise

**Key benefit:**
Consistency and centralized control.

---

## 8. SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

**Linux security framework using mandatory access control (MAC).**

* Limits what users and processes can do
* Prevents processes from exceeding allowed actions
* Stronger than traditional discretionary access control

**Exam keyword:** Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

---

## 9. Data Encryption Levels

**Encryption protects data from unauthorized access.**

Data can be encrypted at:

* Full disk
* Partition
* Volume
* File
* Database
* Record (row-level)

**Key idea:**
Lower levels = more granular control
Higher levels = broader protection

---

## 10. Secure Baselines

**A secure baseline is a known-good configuration standard.**

* Predefined secure settings
* Used as a starting point
* Helps ensure consistency and compliance

**Purpose:**
Reduce misconfigurations and security drift.

---

## Big Picture (Exam Takeaway)

Hardening focuses on **reducing exposure** by:

* Removing unnecessary functionality
* Locking down configurations
* Enforcing strong controls
* Keeping systems updated
* Applying consistent security standards

If you remember this flow, you’ll do great on exam questions:

> **Change defaults → Restrict access → Reduce services → Patch systems → Enforce policies → Encrypt data → Maintain secure baselines**
