## Restricting Applications – Exam Summary

Every application installed on a system introduces **additional code**, which increases the **attack surface** and potential vulnerabilities. More applications mean more patching, more management, and more risk.

---

## 1. Least Functionality

**Least functionality** means configuring systems to provide **only what is essential**.

This includes restricting:

* Unneeded applications
* Unnecessary services
* Open ports
* Unused protocols

**Goal:**
Reduce vulnerabilities by minimizing what can run on a system.

---

## 2. Removing Unnecessary Applications

* Every installed application must be:

  * Managed
  * Updated
  * Patched
* Old or unused applications often remain installed after upgrades (example: multiple versions of the same software)

**Key risk:**
Outdated software introduces known vulnerabilities.

---

## 3. Configuration Management & Secure Baselines

In enterprise environments, systems are controlled using **configuration management**.

### Secure Baseline Image

A secure baseline includes:

* Operating system
* Minimum required applications
* Strict configuration policies

This baseline is:

* Deployed to all workstations
* Updated over time using tools like **Group Policy**

**Why it matters:**
Prevents users from installing unnecessary or risky software.

---

## 4. Restricting Which Applications Can Run

To stop users from installing or running unauthorized software, administrators restrict applications using **lists**.

There are **two main methods**:

---

## 5. Application Allowlisting

**Allowlisting = deny by default**

* Only applications on the approved list can run
* Everything else is blocked

**Key points:**

* Most secure option
* Similar to an “explicit allow” ACL
* Prevents unknown or unauthorized software

**Downside:**

* Harder to manage
* Lists must be updated whenever applications are updated or changed

**Best for:**
High-security environments

---

## 6. Application Blocklisting

**Blocklisting = allow by default**

* Applications on the blocklist are denied
* Everything else is allowed

**Key points:**

* Easier to manage
* Less secure than allowlisting
* New malware is allowed until explicitly blocked

**Best for:**
Lower-security environments or as a minimum security control

---

## 7. Centralized Management

In Windows domain environments:

* **Active Directory** and **Group Policy** can:

  * Manage allowlists and blocklists
  * Deploy restrictions across all systems centrally

This makes large-scale enforcement possible.

---

## Exam Comparison (Very Important)

| Method       | Default Action   | Security Level | Management |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Allowlisting | Block everything | Highest        | Harder     |
| Blocklisting | Allow everything | Lower          | Easier     |

---

## Key Exam Takeaways

* **Least functionality** reduces attack surface
* Fewer applications = fewer vulnerabilities
* **Allowlisting** is more secure than blocklisting
* **Blocklisting** is easier but riskier
* Secure baselines and configuration management are essential in enterprises
* Centralized control (AD + Group Policy) enables large-scale enforcement

---

### Memory Tip

* **Allowlist = “Only these are allowed”**
* **Blocklist = “Everything except these is allowed”**
