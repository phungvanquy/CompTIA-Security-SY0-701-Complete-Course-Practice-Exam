## Trusted Operating Systems (TOS) – Exam Summary

### 1. What Is a Trusted Operating System?

A **Trusted Operating System (TOS)** is an OS designed to provide a **highly secure computing environment** by enforcing **strict security policies**, primarily using **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**.

TOS are used when **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** are critical.

**Common use cases:**

* Military systems
* Aircraft and avionics
* Medical devices
* Embedded and mission-critical systems

---

## 2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

**MAC is the defining feature of a TOS.**

* Access decisions are:

  * Defined by **system administrators**
  * **Enforced by the operating system**
* Users **cannot change permissions**, even for their own data

### MAC vs DAC (exam favorite)

* **DAC (Discretionary Access Control):**

  * Data owners decide who gets access
* **MAC:**

  * System policy decides access
  * Stronger and more secure

---

## 3. Common Criteria & EAL Ratings

Trusted OS security is evaluated using the **Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation**.

### Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL)

* **EAL1** → Lowest assurance
* **EAL7** → Highest assurance

Higher EAL = more:

* Design rigor
* Testing
* Verification
* Cost

---

## 4. Examples of Trusted Operating Systems

### High-Assurance (EAL6+)

* **Integrity-178B**

  * Used in:

    * F-16, F-22, F-35
    * B-2 Bomber
    * Airbus A380
  * **EAL6**
  * POSIX-based
  * Embedded, mission-critical OS

These systems are **purpose-built**, not general-purpose.

---

### Medium-Assurance (EAL4 / EAL4+)

* **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**

  * Adds MAC to Linux
  * Runs on distributions like Red Hat and CentOS
  * Uses policies to:

    * Enforce least privilege
    * Confine processes
  * **EAL4+**

* **Trusted Solaris**

  * MAC-based
  * Supports:

    * Multi-level security
    * Detailed auditing
    * Process and data compartmentalization

* **General-purpose OS**

  * Windows (since Windows 7): **EAL4 / EAL4+**
  * macOS (since 10.6): **EAL4 / EAL4+**
  * Many Linux distributions: **EAL4 / EAL4+**

> EAL4 means the OS was **methodically designed, tested, and reviewed**.

---

## 5. Trusted Computing Base (TCB)

The **Trusted Computing Base** includes **all components critical to system security**.

### Microkernels

Trusted OSs often use **microkernel architecture** to:

* Minimize the TCB
* Reduce attack surface
* Lower risk of vulnerabilities

Smaller TCB = **more secure system**

---

## 6. Trusted OS in Mobile Devices

Modern mobile OSs use **trusted computing concepts**, even if not full TOSs.

### Example: Android

* Uses:

  * Application sandboxing
  * MAC enforcement
  * Security tools like **AppArmor**
* Apps are isolated from:

  * Each other
  * Critical system resources

---

## 7. Cost and Practical Limitations

Trusted operating systems:

* Are **expensive to design**
* Are **complex to maintain**
* Can reduce:

  * Performance
  * Usability
  * Flexibility

Because of this:

* **EAL6–EAL7** → Used only in specialized systems
* **EAL4–EAL4+** → Common for enterprise OSs

Organizations must **balance security vs usability**.

---

## 8. Key Exam Takeaways (Memorize This)

* **TOS = MAC-based OS**
* **MAC > DAC** for security
* **Common Criteria** measures assurance
* **EAL4** = good security (Windows/macOS/Linux)
* **EAL6+** = embedded, mission-critical systems
* **Microkernels reduce TCB**
* **SELinux = MAC for Linux**
