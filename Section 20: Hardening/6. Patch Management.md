## Patch Management – Exam Summary

### What is Patch Management?

**Patch management** is the process of:

> **Planning, Testing, Implementing, and Auditing** software and firmware patches.

It applies to:

* **Workstations (clients)**
* **Servers**
* **Network devices**
* **Mobile devices**

---

## Why Patch Management Is Important (Know These 4 Reasons)

1. **Security**

   * Fixes known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
   * Reduces attack surface

2. **Uptime & Stability**

   * Prevents crashes, resource exhaustion, and system failures

3. **Compliance**

   * Auditors often check patch status
   * Systems must be protected against known vulnerabilities

4. **Features & Improvements**

   * Some patches add new functionality or enhancements

---

## The Patch Management Lifecycle (Very Important for the Exam)

### 1. Planning

* Create **policies and procedures**
* Track available patches
* Verify **compatibility** with systems
* Decide **how patches will be tested and deployed**
* Use centralized tools to track status

**Examples of tools:**

* Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM)
* Third-party patch management tools

---

### 2. Testing

* Always test patches **before full deployment**
* Patches can introduce new bugs
* Use:

  * Test lab
  * Test workstation
  * Limited production group

**Why testing matters:**

* Every network has unique configurations
* Prevents mass outages and user disruption

---

### 3. Implementation

* Deploy patches after successful testing
* Methods:

  * **Manual** (small networks)
  * **Automated** (large networks – recommended)

**Enterprise best practice:**

* Use an **update server**, not direct Windows Update
* Maintain full control over patch timing and approval

**Patch Rings (Phased Deployment):**

* Ring 1: Small test group
* Ring 2: IT staff / service desk
* Ring 3: Larger user group
* Ring 4: Entire organization

**Benefits:**

* Limits impact of bad patches
* Reduces help desk workload

---

### 4. Auditing

* Verify patches installed correctly
* Identify failed or missing updates
* Scan systems for compliance

**Auditing answers questions like:**

* Was the patch installed?
* Did it fail?
* Is the system still vulnerable?

---

## Patch Management by Platform

### Windows

* Managed via:

  * MECM
  * Third-party tools
* Large orgs disable automatic Windows Update

### Linux / macOS

* Use built-in package managers
* Same lifecycle: plan → test → deploy → audit

### Mobile Devices

* Managed through **MDM (Mobile Device Management)** systems

---

## Firmware Management (Exam Favorite)

Patch management is **not just for computers**.

### Network Devices Also Need Updates

* Routers, switches, firewalls run **firmware**
* Outdated firmware = security vulnerabilities

**Examples:**

* Cisco devices run **Cisco IOS**
* Firmware updates require flashing the device

### Firmware Management Tools

* Vendor tools (e.g., Cisco UCS Manager)
* Third-party tools (e.g., ManageEngine Device Expert)

**Key idea:**

> Firmware management = patch management for network devices

---

## Key Exam Takeaways (Memorize This)

* Patch management = **Planning, Testing, Implementing, Auditing**
* Supports **security, uptime, compliance, and features**
* Testing prevents widespread failures
* Large networks use **automation and centralized tools**
* Patch rings reduce risk
* Firmware must be managed just like OS patches
* CVEs drive the need for patching
