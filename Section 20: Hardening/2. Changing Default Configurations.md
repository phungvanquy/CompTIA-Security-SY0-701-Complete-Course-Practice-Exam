## Changing Default Configurations – Exam Summary

When hardware or software is first installed, it uses **default (factory) configurations**.
These defaults prioritize **ease of use**, **not security**, and leaving them unchanged creates **serious security risks**.

**Key principle:**
👉 *Default configurations increase your attack surface and must be changed immediately.*

---

## 1. Default Passwords

**Default credentials are one of the biggest security risks.**

* Manufacturers ship devices with well-known credentials

  * Examples: `admin/admin`, `admin/password`, `admin` with no password
* These credentials are:

  * Publicly documented
  * Known by attackers

### Best Practices

* **Change default passwords immediately**
* Use **long, strong, unique, complex passwords**
* Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** if supported
* Rotate administrative passwords about **every 90 days**
* Use a **password manager** to generate and store credentials

**Exam takeaway:**
Default passwords must always be changed because they are **public knowledge**.

## 2. Disable Unneeded Ports and Protocols

**Every open port is a potential entry point for attackers.**

* Devices enable many ports and protocols by default
* Many are **not required** for your organization

### Best Practices

* Audit all enabled ports and protocols
* Disable anything not required for operations
* Reduces the **attack surface**

### Use Secure Versions of Protocols

Replace insecure protocols with encrypted alternatives:

| Insecure    | Secure            |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| HTTP (80)   | HTTPS (443)       |
| SMTP (25)   | SMTPS (465 / 587) |
| Telnet (23) | SSH (22)          |

**Exam takeaway:**
Disable unused ports and prefer **encrypted protocols** whenever possible.

## 3. Close Unnecessary Open Ports

**Many systems ship with multiple ports open “just in case.”**

Common default open ports include:

* 22 (SSH)
* 23 (Telnet)
* 80 (HTTP)
* 443 (HTTPS)

### Examples

* **Telnet (23)**

  * Sends data unencrypted
  * Should always be disabled
* **HTTP (80)**

  * Less secure than HTTPS
  * Close if HTTPS (443) is available

**Exam takeaway:**
If a service is not required—or has a more secure alternative—the port should be closed.

## Key Exam Concepts to Remember

* Default configurations = **insecure by design**
* Change defaults immediately after installation
* Focus areas:

  1. Default passwords
  2. Unneeded ports and protocols
  3. Excess open ports
* Smaller attack surface = **better security**
* Simple actions (password changes, port closures) are powerful defenses

## Final Exam Tip

> Security improvement doesn’t always require advanced tools.
> **Basic hardening steps**—like changing passwords and closing ports—are often the **first and strongest line of defense**.
