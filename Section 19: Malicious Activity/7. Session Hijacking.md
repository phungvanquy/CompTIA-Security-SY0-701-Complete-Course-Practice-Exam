## Session Hijacking – Exam Summary

---

## 1. Session Management (Foundation Concept)

**Session management allows a web application to identify a user across multiple requests.**

* Tracks user state (logged-in status, progress, preferences)
* Stores session data:

  * In a **database**
  * In **cookies**

### Why Session Management Is Needed

* **HTTP is stateless**

  * The server does not remember clients by default
* Sessions maintain continuity between requests

---

## 2. Cookies

**Cookies are small text files stored on the client that hold session-related data.**

* Created by the server
* Sent back to the server with each HTTP request
* Used to identify the user’s session

### Types of Cookies

#### Session Cookies

* **Non-persistent**
* Stored in memory
* Deleted when the browser is closed

#### Persistent Cookies

* Stored in browser cache
* Remain until:

  * Expiration date
  * Manually deleted by user

---

## 3. Cookie Security

Cookies often contain sensitive information, so they must be protected.

**Best practices:**

* Encrypt cookies (confidentiality)
* Limit cookie lifetime
* Delete cookies after session termination
* Avoid storing sensitive data when possible

---

## 4. Session Hijacking

**Session hijacking is a type of spoofing attack where an attacker takes over a valid user session.**

### How It Works

* Attacker steals or modifies a session cookie
* Attacker impersonates the legitimate user
* Server cannot distinguish attacker from real user

### Common Methods

* Cookie theft
* Cookie modification
* IP spoofing
* Man-in-the-middle attacks (implied)

---

## 5. Session Prediction

**A form of session hijacking where attackers guess session tokens.**

* Occurs if session tokens are predictable
* Tokens must:

  * Be random
  * Be generated using non-predictable algorithms
  * Reveal no information about the user

**Exam Tip:**
Session tokens should function like **one-time-use tickets** for the session duration.

---

## 6. Cookie Poisoning

**Cookie poisoning modifies the contents of a cookie to exploit a web application.**

### Attack Goal

* Alter cookie values
* Exploit application logic or trust assumptions

### Prevention Methods

* Validate all input (including cookies)
* Encrypt cookies (in transit and storage)
* Delete cookies when sessions end
* Do not trust client-side data

---

## 7. Defensive Best Practices (Big Picture)

To protect against session hijacking and cookie-based attacks:

* Encrypt cookies
* Use secure, unpredictable session tokens
* Limit cookie lifetime
* Delete cookies after logout
* Validate all cookie input
* Avoid unnecessary cookie usage
* Store sensitive data server-side when possible

---

## Exam Takeaway (Quick Recall)

* **HTTP is stateless → sessions are required**
* **Cookies store session data**
* **Session hijacking = stealing or guessing session tokens**
* **Session prediction = predictable tokens**
* **Cookie poisoning = modifying cookie contents**
* **Encryption + validation + short lifetimes = protection**
