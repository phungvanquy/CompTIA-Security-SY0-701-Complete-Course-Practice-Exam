# Denial of Service (DoS) & DDoS – Exam Summary

## What is a Denial of Service (DoS) Attack?

A **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack is **any attack that makes a system unavailable** to legitimate users by exhausting its resources.

Targets can include:

* Servers
* Workstations
* Network devices (routers, switches)

📌 **Key idea:**
If a system **can’t provide its intended service**, it’s a DoS condition.

---

## Major Categories of DoS Attacks

### 1. Flood Attacks

**Overwhelm a system with more traffic than it can handle**

#### a. Ping Flood

* Uses excessive **ICMP echo requests (pings)**
* Goal: overwhelm the target
* Common defense: **block ICMP at the firewall**

📌 Exam note: Ping = ICMP echo request

---

#### b. SYN Flood

* Exploits the **TCP three-way handshake**
* Attacker sends many **SYN packets**
* Never completes the handshake
* Server keeps resources open → runs out of memory

📌 Results in many **half-open connections**

**Mitigations:**

* Flood guards
* Firewalls / routers with SYN protection
* Shorter TCP timeouts
* Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

---

### 2. Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS)

Also called **phlashing**

* Re-flashes or corrupts device firmware
* Device **cannot reboot normally**
* Requires full firmware reload or replacement

📌 Key exam point:
Rebooting **does NOT fix** a PDoS

---

### 3. Fork Bomb

* Creates massive numbers of processes
* Exhausts CPU and memory
* Spreads **only locally**, not over the network

📌 Not a worm
📌 Causes DoS by resource exhaustion

---

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

### What is DDoS?

A **DDoS attack uses many systems at once** to overwhelm a single target.

* Uses **hundreds or thousands of machines**
* Often controlled as a **botnet**
* Bots (zombies) attack simultaneously

📌 Key difference:

* **DoS** = one attacker
* **DDoS** = many attackers

---

## Specialized DDoS Attack

### DNS Amplification Attack

A **reflection + amplification attack**

How it works:

1. Attacker sends small DNS requests
2. Uses **spoofed IP address of the victim**
3. DNS servers send **large responses** to victim
4. Bandwidth is amplified

📌 Small request → Large response
📌 Very effective for bandwidth exhaustion

---

## Real-World Example (Exam Context)

* GitHub hit by **1.35 Tbps DDoS** (2018)
* Took site offline for ~5 minutes
* Shows scale and speed of modern DDoS attacks

---

## DDoS Mitigation Techniques

### 1. Blackholing / Sinkholing

* Routes attack traffic to a **null interface**
* Stops traffic immediately

⚠️ Temporary solution
⚠️ Attackers can change IPs

---

### 2. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

* Detect and block smaller DoS attacks
* **Not effective alone** for large DDoS attacks

---

### 3. Elastic Cloud Infrastructure

* Automatically scales resources during attack
* Can “ride out” the attack

⚠️ Major downside: **high cost**
⚠️ No revenue from attack traffic

---

### 4. Specialized DDoS Protection Services (BEST OPTION)

Examples:

* **Cloudflare**
* **Akamai**

They provide:

* Traffic filtering
* Content distribution (CDN)
* Massive bandwidth capacity
* Multi-layer OSI protection

📌 Most effective enterprise-level defense

---

## Quick Memory Aids

### DoS Attack Types

**F-S-P-F**

* **F**lood
* **S**YN flood
* **P**ermanent (PDoS)
* **F**ork bomb

---

### DDoS Defense (BEST → WORST)

1. Cloud DDoS providers (Cloudflare/Akamai)
2. Elastic cloud scaling
3. IPS
4. Blackholing

---

## Final Exam Takeaways

* DoS = resource exhaustion
* DDoS = many attackers, one target
* SYN flood = half-open TCP connections
* DNS amplification = small request, big response
* Best DDoS defense = **specialized cloud mitigation**
