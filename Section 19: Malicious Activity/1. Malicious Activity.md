# Malicious Activity – Domain 2.4 Exam Summary

## Big Picture

**Malicious activity** refers to intentional actions designed to **disrupt, damage, steal, or gain unauthorized access** to systems, networks, or data.

* Attacks are **increasing in frequency and sophistication**
* Understanding threats is the **first step to prevention and mitigation**
* Exam focus: **Recognize attack types and their indicators**

---

## Core Objective (EXAM WORDING)

> **Given a scenario, analyze indicators of malicious activity**

This means you must:

* Identify **what type of attack is occurring**
* Recognize **symptoms and behaviors (IoCs)** associated with attacks

---

## Major Attack Categories Covered

### 1. Denial of Service (DoS / DDoS)

**Goal:** Make a system unavailable

#### Types:

* **DoS** – Single source floods a target
* **DDoS** – Multiple compromised systems attack at once
* **Amplified DDoS** – Small requests cause large responses
* **Reflected DDoS** – Attacker spoofs victim’s IP to redirect responses

📌 Key indicator: **Resource exhaustion (CPU, bandwidth, memory)**

---

### 2. DNS Attacks

**Goal:** Disrupt or manipulate name resolution

#### Types:

* **DNS Cache Poisoning** – Corrupt DNS records
* **DNS Amplification** – Used in DDoS attacks
* **DNS Tunneling** – Hides data in DNS traffic
* **Domain Hijacking** – Unauthorized control of domain
* **Zone Transfer Attack** – Steals DNS records

📌 Key indicator: **Unexpected DNS behavior or traffic spikes**

---

### 3. Directory Traversal (Path Traversal)

**Goal:** Access unauthorized files/directories

* Exploits poor input validation
* Uses patterns like `../`

📌 Key indicator: **Unauthorized file access attempts**

---

### 4. Privilege Escalation

**Goal:** Gain higher permissions than authorized

* Exploits system or application vulnerabilities
* Can be:

  * **Vertical** (user → admin)
  * **Horizontal** (user → another user)

📌 Key indicator: **Unexpected admin-level actions**

---

### 5. Replay Attacks

**Goal:** Reuse valid authentication data

* Intercepts and retransmits legitimate data
* Common in poorly protected authentication systems

📌 Key indicator: **Duplicate or delayed authentication requests**

---

### 6. Session Hijacking

**Also known as:**

* Sidejacking
* Cookie hijacking
* Session key hijacking

**Goal:** Take over an active user session

📌 Key indicator: **Concurrent sessions or abnormal session behavior**

---

### 7. Malicious Code Injection

**Goal:** Execute unauthorized code

* Includes SQL injection, command injection, script injection
* Causes systems to behave unexpectedly

📌 Key indicator: **Unexpected system behavior or data manipulation**

---

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) – VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAM

These are **observable signs** that malicious activity may be occurring:

### Common IoCs:

* **Account lockouts**
* **Concurrent session usage**
* **Blocked or altered content**
* **Impossible travel** (logins from distant locations too quickly)
* **High resource consumption**
* **Resource inaccessibility**
* **Out-of-cycle logging**
* **Defacement / “You’ve been hacked” messages**
* **Missing or deleted log files**

📌 Exam tip: IoCs help you **detect**, not prevent, attacks

---

## How to Think on Exam Questions

When given a scenario, ask:

1. What **symptom** is described?
2. Which **attack type** matches that symptom?
3. Which **indicator of compromise** is present?

---

## One-Line Memory Aid

**“DDoS floods, DNS lies, paths escape, privileges rise, sessions stolen, code injected — watch the indicators.”**

---

## Final Takeaway

* Malicious activity comes in **many forms**
* Attacks leave **patterns and indicators**
* Your job as a defender is to **recognize and analyze those signs**
* Domain 2.4 tests **analysis**, not memorization alone
