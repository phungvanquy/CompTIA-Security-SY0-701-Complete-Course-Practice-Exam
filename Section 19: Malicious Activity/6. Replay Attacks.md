## Replay Attacks – Exam Summary

### What Is a Replay Attack?

A **replay attack** is a **network-based attack** where an attacker:

* **Intercepts valid data transmissions**
* **Records them**
* **Re-sends (replays) them later** to gain unauthorized access

The data itself is **legitimate**, but it is used **fraudulently**.

---

### Replay Attack vs. Session Hijacking

* **Session Hijacking**

  * Attacker takes over a session **in real time**
  * Actively modifies or injects traffic

* **Replay Attack**

  * Attacker **captures data first**
  * Replays it **later**
  * No real-time interaction required

👉 **Key difference for the exam:**
Replay attacks reuse captured data, not live manipulation.

### Common Replay Attack Example

1. User logs into a service (bank, shopping site, etc.)
2. Attacker captures authentication data or session traffic
3. Attacker replays the captured session later
4. Attacker gains access **as the legitimate user**

**Possible consequences:**

* Unauthorized logins
* Fraudulent purchases
* Password changes
* Account takeover

---

### Credential Replay Attacks

* Focus specifically on **authentication credentials**
* Use captured login data to repeatedly access accounts
* Especially dangerous if passwords never change

---

### How Replay Attacks Are Prevented (Mitigations)

#### 1. Session Tokens

* Unique, temporary identifiers per session
* Prevent reused authentication data from working again
* Makes replayed sessions invalid

#### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

* Requires something **additional** beyond username/password
* Examples:

  * One-time passwords (OTP)
  * Authenticator apps (codes change every 30–60 seconds)
* Captured credentials alone are useless

#### 3. Secure Protocols

* Use modern security standards
* Example:

  * **WPA3** (protects against replay attacks in wireless networks)

---

### Key Exam Takeaways

* Replay attacks involve **rebroadcasting valid data**
* The attacker **does not change** the data
* Replay attacks often target **login sessions**
* **Session tokens + MFA** are the most effective defenses
* **WPA3** helps prevent replay attacks in wireless environments

### Quick Memory Hook (Exam Tip)

> **Replay = Record → Reuse → Access**
