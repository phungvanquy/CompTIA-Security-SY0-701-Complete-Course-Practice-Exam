## DNS Attacks – Exam Summary

**DNS (Domain Name System)** translates human-readable domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses.
Because DNS is critical to internet communication, it is a **high-value target** for attackers.

## 1. DNS Cache Poisoning (DNS Spoofing)

**What it is:**

* Attacker inserts **false DNS records** into a DNS resolver’s cache
* Users are redirected to a **malicious IP address**

**Example:**

* Users trying to visit a bank are redirected to a fake site that steals credentials

**Impact:**

* Credential theft
* Malware delivery
* Loss of trust

**Mitigation:**

* **DNSSEC** (adds digital signatures to DNS records)
* Secure DNS server configurations
* Firewalls to prevent unauthorized DNS access

---

## 2. DNS Amplification Attack

**What it is:**

* A **DDoS attack** using DNS servers
* Attacker sends small queries with a **spoofed victim IP**
* DNS server replies with **large responses** to the victim

**Why it works:**

* Small request → large response (amplification effect)

**Impact:**

* Network congestion
* Denial of service

**Mitigation:**

* Rate-limit DNS responses
* Limit response size
* Do not run **open DNS resolvers**

## 3. DNS Tunneling

**What it is:**

* Using DNS to carry **non-DNS traffic** (e.g., data exfiltration, command & control)
* Typically uses **port 53** to bypass firewall rules

**Legitimate use:**

* Some controlled network scenarios

**Malicious use:**

* Stealing sensitive data
* Maintaining hidden attacker control

**Why it’s dangerous:**

* DNS traffic is often allowed without inspection

**Mitigation:**

* Monitor and analyze DNS logs
* Look for unusual query patterns
* Use DNS traffic inspection tools

---

## 4. Domain Hijacking (Domain Theft)

**What it is:**

* Unauthorized changes to **domain registration**
* Attacker gains control of the domain

**Impact:**

* Website redirection
* Credential and payment theft
* Brand damage

**Mitigation:**

* Secure registrar accounts
* Regularly update credentials
* Use **domain registry lock services**

---

## 5. DNS Zone Transfer Attack

**What it is:**

* Attacker requests a full **DNS zone transfer**
* Pretends to be an authorized DNS server

**Impact:**

* Reveals internal DNS records
* Exposes network structure
* Used for reconnaissance

**Mitigation (implied for exam):**

* Restrict zone transfers
* Allow transfers only to authorized servers

## Quick Exam Memory Table

| Attack Type      | Main Goal         | Key Defense        |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Cache Poisoning  | Redirect users    | DNSSEC             |
| Amplification    | DDoS              | Rate limiting      |
| Tunneling        | Data exfiltration | DNS monitoring     |
| Domain Hijacking | Take over domain  | Registry locks     |
| Zone Transfer    | Reconnaissance    | Restrict transfers |

## Big Exam Takeaway

DNS attacks aim to:

* **Redirect traffic**
* **Disrupt service**
* **Steal data**
* **Gather intelligence**

Understanding **how each attack works** and **how to mitigate it** is critical for both real-world security and passing the exam.
