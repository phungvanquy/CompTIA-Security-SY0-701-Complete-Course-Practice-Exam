## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) – Exam Summary

**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** are pieces of **forensic evidence** that suggest a system or network **may have been breached**.
They are **clues**, not absolute proof—each IoC must be analyzed to determine whether it’s a **real attack or a false positive**.

---

## 1. Account Lockouts

**What it is:**
An account is locked after multiple failed login attempts.

**Why it matters:**

* Common sign of a **brute-force attack**
* Attacker is guessing passwords

**Key points for exam:**

* Lockout thresholds vary
* Lockouts may be:

  * **Time-based** (auto-unlock)
  * **Manual** (admin intervention)
* Must balance **security vs usability**

---

## 2. Concurrent Session Usage

**What it is:**
Multiple active sessions using the same account at the same time.

**Why it matters:**

* Could indicate **account compromise**
* Attacker and user logged in simultaneously

**Exam tip:**

* Can be a false positive (multiple devices)
* Stronger concern if sessions occur from **different locations**

---

## 3. Blocked Content

**What it is:**
Attempts to access or download content blocked by security controls.

**Why it matters:**

* Could indicate:

  * Malware activity
  * Data exfiltration attempts
  * Compromised user account

**Red flag:**

* Repeated attempts to access blocked files or sites

---

## 4. Impossible Travel

**What it is:**
Logins from geographically distant locations in an impossible timeframe.

**Example:**

* Login from New York, then London within one hour

**Why it matters:**

* Physical travel is impossible → **high likelihood of compromise**

**Exam note:**

* Often paired with **concurrent session usage**

---

## 5. Resource Consumption

**What it is:**
Unexpected spikes in CPU, memory, GPU, or bandwidth usage.

**Why it matters:**
May indicate:

* Malware infection
* DDoS attack
* Crypto-mining malware (very common)

**Example:**

* CPU jumps from 20% to 90%
* GPU usage spikes during normal browsing

---

## 6. Resource Inaccessibility

**What it is:**
Users suddenly cannot access files, databases, or services.

**Why it matters:**

* Common sign of **ransomware**
* Files may be encrypted

**Clear indicator:**

* Ransom note appears

---

## 7. Out-of-Cycle Logging

**What it is:**
System activity during unusual hours (late night, weekends).

**Why it matters:**

* Attackers often operate during **off-peak hours**
* Easier to avoid detection

**Example:**

* Login activity at 3:00 AM when business is closed

---

## 8. Missing Logs

**What it is:**
Gaps in log files where data should exist.

**Why it matters:**

* Attackers may **delete logs** to hide activity
* Makes forensic investigation harder

**Exam keyword:**

* *Log tampering*

---

## 9. Public Disclosure of a Hack

**What it is:**
Evidence published stating the organization was hacked.

**Where it may appear:**

* Social media
* Hacker forums
* News articles
* Website defacement

**Why it matters:**

* Often intentional for reputation damage or bragging
* Very strong indicator of compromise

---

## Key Exam Takeaways

* IoCs are **evidence**, not confirmation
* One IoC ≠ guaranteed breach
* Multiple IoCs together = **stronger confidence**
* False positives are common
* Log analysis is a **core cybersecurity skill**

## Memory Tip (Quick Recall)

Think: **“A C-B I R R O M P”**

* **A**ccount lockouts
* **C**oncurrent sessions
* **B**locked content
* **I**mpossible travel
* **R**esource consumption
* **R**esource inaccessibility
* **O**ut-of-cycle logging
* **M**issing logs
* **P**ublic disclosure
