## On-Path Attacks (Man-in-the-Middle) – Exam Summary

---

## 1. What Is an On-Path Attack?

An **on-path attack** (also called an interception or man-in-the-middle attack) occurs when an attacker:

* Logically places themselves **between two communicating hosts**
* **Transparently intercepts, monitors, relays, or modifies** traffic
* Often steals **authentication or session data** to take over a session

**Key idea:**
The client and server believe they are talking directly to each other, but all traffic passes through the attacker.

---

## 2. Common On-Path Attack Techniques

Attackers can place themselves in the communication path using:

* **ARP poisoning**
* **DNS poisoning**
* **Rogue wireless access point**
* **Rogue switch**

These methods redirect traffic through the attacker without the victim noticing.

---

## 3. Replay vs Relay Attacks

### Replay Attack

* Attacker **captures valid data** (e.g., authentication handshake)
* **Re-sends (replays)** it immediately or later
* Common in **wireless networks**, but works on wired networks too

**Example:**
Replay an authentication handshake to gain unauthorized access.

---

### Relay Attack

* Attacker becomes an **active proxy** between client and server
* Traffic flows:

  * Client → Attacker → Server
  * Server → Attacker → Client
* Attacker can:

  * Read data
  * Modify data
  * Steal credentials (usernames, passwords, financial data)

**Memory tip:**

* *Replay = repeat captured data*
* *Relay = pass traffic along (possibly modified)*

---

## 4. Encryption as a Defense

Strong encryption (e.g., **TLS 1.2 / TLS 1.3**) makes on-path attacks:

* Very difficult
* Sometimes impossible

Because attackers cannot easily read or alter encrypted traffic.

---

## 5. SSL Stripping

**SSL stripping** attempts to defeat encryption by:

* Downgrading an **HTTPS connection to HTTP**
* Removing encryption entirely

**Result:**

* No encryption
* Attacker can read all traffic

**Example:**
User requests `https://facebook.com`, attacker forces `http://facebook.com`.

---

## 6. Downgrade Attacks

If SSL stripping fails, attackers may attempt a **downgrade attack**.

### Downgrade Attack Definition

* Forces client and server to use a **lower security protocol**
* Appears secure (lock icon still present)
* Uses **weaker, easier-to-crack encryption**

**Example:**

* Client requests TLS 1.3
* Attacker forces SSL 2.0 instead

---

## 7. Downgrade Attacks Are Not Limited to TLS

Downgrade attacks can affect:

* **SSL / TLS**
* **Wi-Fi security**
* **VPNs**
* **Any protocol with backward compatibility**

**Key rule:**
If a system negotiates to a **lower but still supported security level**, it is vulnerable to a downgrade attack.

---

## Exam Quick Recall

* **On-path attack** = attacker sits between two hosts
* **Replay** = capture and resend data
* **Relay** = intercept, forward, and possibly modify data
* **SSL stripping** = HTTPS → HTTP
* **Downgrade attack** = strong security → weaker security
* **Strong encryption reduces attack success**
