## Execution & Escalation Attacks – Exam Summary

These attacks focus on **running attacker-controlled code** and **gaining higher privileges** by exploiting software vulnerabilities.

Key topics:

* Arbitrary Code Execution
* Remote Code Execution
* Privilege Escalation
* Rootkits

---

## 1. Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)

**Definition:**
A vulnerability that allows an attacker to run **any code they choose** on a system.

* The attacker executes their own malicious code
* Happens due to software vulnerabilities
* Code runs **without authorization**

**Key idea:**

> The attacker controls *what* code runs on the system

---

## 2. Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Definition:**
A type of arbitrary code execution where the attacker runs code **from a remote system**, usually over a network or the internet.

**Difference from ACE:**

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Code runs locally
* **Remote Code Execution:** Code runs remotely

**Exam tip:**

> RCE is **more dangerous** because it does not require local access

---

## 3. Privilege Escalation

**Definition:**
Occurs when an attacker gains access to resources or permissions they are **not authorized** to have.

**Goal:**

* Gain **administrator**, **root**, or **domain admin** privileges

---

### Types of Privilege Escalation

#### A. Vertical Privilege Escalation

* Move **up** in privilege level
* Example:

  * User → Administrator
  * User → Root

**Most common on exams**

**Typical scenario:**

* User clicks malicious link
* Code runs
* Attacker gains admin privileges

---

#### B. Horizontal Privilege Escalation

* Same privilege level, **different user**
* Example:

  * Accessing another user’s files
  * Impersonating another user account

**Key idea:**

> Same level, different identity

---

### Why Privileges Matter

* Every application runs with specific permissions
* If attackers inject code into:

  * A user process → user privileges
  * An admin process → admin privileges
  * A system process → **system privileges**

**Important concept:**

> Malicious code inherits the permissions of the process running it

---

## 4. Rootkits

**Definition:**
A class of malware designed to **hide its presence** by modifying system components, often at the kernel level.

**Why rootkits are dangerous:**

* Extremely hard to detect
* Enable long-term persistence
* Can hide malware, attackers, and malicious activity
* Survive:

  * Reboots
  * Logoffs
  * Security scans

---

## Rings & Privilege Levels (Important for Rootkits)

Systems are designed with **privilege rings**:

* **Ring 0** – Kernel (most privileged)
* **Ring 1–2** – Device drivers
* **Ring 3** – Applications (least privileged)

Closer to Ring 0 = **more power and more danger**

---

## Types of Rootkits

### A. Kernel-Mode Rootkit

* Operates at **Ring 0**
* Full control of the system
* Can hide completely from security tools

**Most dangerous rootkit type**

---

### B. User-Mode Rootkit

* Runs at application or admin level
* Uses OS features for persistence:

  * Registry
  * Task Scheduler
* Easier to detect than kernel rootkits

## Exam Comparisons to Remember

| Concept                  | Key Point                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Arbitrary Code Execution | Attacker runs any code       |
| Remote Code Execution    | Code executed remotely       |
| Vertical Escalation      | Gain higher privileges       |
| Horizontal Escalation    | Same level, different user   |
| Kernel Rootkit           | Ring 0, most dangerous       |
| User Rootkit             | Higher-level, less dangerous |

---

## Big Exam Takeaway

Execution and escalation attacks focus on:

* **Running attacker code**
* **Gaining higher privileges**
* **Hiding presence for persistence**

Understanding **how code executes**, **what privileges it gains**, and **where malware hides** is critical for detecting and preventing these attacks.
