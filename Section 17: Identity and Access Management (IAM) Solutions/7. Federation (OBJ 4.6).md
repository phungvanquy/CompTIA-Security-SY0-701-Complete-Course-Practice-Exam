# Federation (Identity & Access Management) – Exam Summary

## What Is Federation?

**Federation** allows a user to **authenticate once** and access **multiple systems across different organizations** using **one set of credentials**.

📌 It is **NOT password reuse**
📌 It is **trusted single sign-on across organizations**

---

## Why Federation Is Used

Organizations need to grant access to:

* Employees
* Partners
* Suppliers
* Customers

Managing separate accounts for all external users is complex.
**Federation solves this by trusting another organization’s authentication system.**

---

## Key Federation Components

### Identity Provider (IdP)

* Authenticates the user
* Stores and manages credentials
* Issues authentication assertions (tokens)

### Service Provider (SP)

* The application or service the user wants to access
* Trusts the IdP
* Grants access based on the assertion

📌 **Trust relationship** between IdP and SP is required

## Federation Login Flow (MEMORIZE THIS)

### The 6-Step Federation Process

Use the mnemonic: **L-R-A-G-R-V**

1. **Login Initiation**
   User attempts to access a service

2. **Redirection to IdP**
   Service provider redirects user to Identity Provider

3. **Authentication**
   User authenticates with the IdP

4. **Generation of Assertion**
   IdP creates a signed token (assertion)

5. **Return to Service Provider**
   User is redirected back with the assertion

6. **Verification & Access**
   Service provider validates the assertion and grants access

✔ User may access other federated services **without logging in again**

---

## Federation Protocols (EXAM FAVORITES)

Federation relies on standardized protocols:

* **SAML** (Security Assertion Markup Language)
* **OAuth**
* **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**

📌 These protocols define how assertions/tokens are created and trusted

---

## Benefits of Federation

### 1. Improved User Experience

* One account
* Fewer logins
* Seamless access

### 2. Reduced Administrative Overhead

* No need to manage external user accounts
* Trust partner organizations instead

### 3. Increased Security

* Less password reuse
* Fewer stored credentials
* Reduced risk of password breaches

### 4. Increased Productivity & Lower IT Costs

* Faster access
* Less help desk involvement

## Federation vs Password Reuse (EXAM TRAP)

| Federation               | Password Reuse                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Uses trust relationships | Same password everywhere        |
| Uses tokens/assertions   | No verification between systems |
| Secure                   | Very insecure                   |

📌 Federation = **secure SSO across organizations**

---

## One-Line Exam Definition

**Federation allows users to authenticate with one trusted identity provider and access multiple systems across different organizations without re-authenticating.**
