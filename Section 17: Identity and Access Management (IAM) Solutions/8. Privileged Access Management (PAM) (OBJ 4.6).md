# Privileged Access Management (PAM) – Exam Summary

## What is PAM?

**Privileged Access Management (PAM)** is a security solution that:

* **Restricts**
* **Controls**
* **Monitors**

the use of **privileged accounts** (admin, root, system accounts).

### Goal of PAM

✔ Prevent abuse of powerful accounts
✔ Enforce **least privilege**
✔ Reduce risk of data breaches
✔ Improve accountability and auditing

---

## Why PAM Is Important

Privileged accounts:

* Have **elevated permissions**
* Can bypass security controls
* Are prime targets for attackers

📌 PAM reduces risk from:

* Stolen admin credentials
* Misuse of privileges
* Poor configuration control

## The 3 Core Components of PAM (MEMORIZE THIS)

### **J-P-T Model**

**Just-in-Time → Password Vaulting → Temporal Accounts**

---

## 1. Just-In-Time (JIT) Permissions

**Admin access is granted only when needed**

* Privileges are:

  * Approved
  * Time-limited
  * Automatically revoked
* No standing admin access

📌 Example:

* Admin gets server access for maintenance
* Access is removed immediately after task completion

✅ Reduces:

* Attack window
* Accidental or malicious misuse

---

## 2. Password Vaulting

**Secure storage of privileged credentials**

* Passwords stored in a **secure digital vault**
* Vault access usually requires **MFA**
* All access is **logged and audited**

📌 Used for:

* Admin accounts
* Root accounts
* Service accounts

📌 Exam tip:

* Users **check out** credentials instead of permanently knowing them

---

## 3. Temporal Accounts (Temporary Accounts)

**Time-limited user accounts**

* Created for a **specific task or project**
* Automatically:

  * Disabled
  * Or deleted after expiration

📌 Example:

* Contractor account valid for project duration only

✅ Prevents:

* Forgotten active accounts
* Long-term unauthorized access

---

## PAM and Least Privilege

PAM enforces **least privilege** by:

* Limiting access scope
* Limiting access time
* Removing permanent admin rights

📌 Exam phrase to remember:

> “No standing privileges”

---

## One-Line Memory Aid

**“PAM controls powerful accounts using JIT access, vaulted passwords, and temporary accounts.”**

---

## Key Exam Takeaways

* PAM protects **privileged accounts**
* Core components = **Just-In-Time, Password Vaulting, Temporal Accounts**
* Reduces breach risk
* Enforces least privilege
* Improves logging and accountability
