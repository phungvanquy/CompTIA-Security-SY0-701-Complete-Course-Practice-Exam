# Single Sign-On (SSO) – Exam Summary

## What is SSO?

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** allows a user to **log in once** and gain access to **multiple applications or websites** using **one set of credentials**.

### Key Purpose

✔ Improve usability
✔ Increase productivity
✔ Reduce password fatigue
✔ Improve security

---

## How SSO Works (EXAM FLOW)

SSO relies on a **trusted relationship** between:

* **Identity Provider (IdP)**
* **Service Provider (SP)** (application or website)

### Simplified SSO Process

1. User logs into the **Identity Provider (IdP)**

   * Example: Active Directory, Google, Microsoft
2. User requests access to an SSO-enabled application
3. Application asks the IdP to verify the user
4. IdP sends an **authentication assertion**
5. Application grants access **without another login**

📌 *User authenticates once, accesses many services*

---

## Identity Provider (IdP)

A system that:

* Stores and manages user identities
* Performs authentication
* Sends assertions to trusted applications

📌 Examples:

* Active Directory
* Google
* Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

---

## Benefits of SSO (MEMORIZE THESE)

1. **Improved User Experience**

   * One password to remember
2. **Increased Productivity**

   * No repeated logins
3. **Reduced IT Support Costs**

   * Fewer password reset requests
4. **Enhanced Security**

   * Encourages strong passwords
   * Reduces password reuse

📌 *SSO improves both usability AND security*

---

## Real-World Examples

* “Login with Google”
* Corporate login once → email, HR, SharePoint, tools
* Federated login across trusted partners

---

## SSO Protocols (VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAM)

### 1. LDAP

**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**

✔ Directory and authentication protocol
✔ Centralized user database
✔ Used heavily in enterprise networks

**Functions:**

* Authentication
* Authorization
* User/group management

📌 Secure version: **LDAPS** (LDAP over SSL/TLS)

---

### 2. OAuth

**Open Authorization**

✔ Token-based authentication & authorization
✔ Used for **third-party logins**
✔ Does NOT share passwords

**Key Points:**

* Uses **access tokens**
* Common in APIs and web apps
* Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**

📌 Example: “Login with Google/Facebook”

---

### 3. SAML

**Security Assertion Markup Language**

✔ XML-based authentication standard
✔ Common in enterprise SSO

**How it works:**

* App redirects user to IdP
* IdP authenticates user
* IdP sends **assertion**
* App grants access

📌 SAML separates authentication from applications

## Protocol Comparison (Quick Memory)

| Protocol | Best Known For                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| LDAP     | Directory services & enterprise authentication |
| OAuth    | Token-based authorization & social logins      |
| SAML     | Enterprise federated SSO                       |

---

## Key Exam Takeaways

* SSO = **one login, many services**
* Uses a **trusted identity provider**
* Reduces password fatigue
* Improves productivity & security
* Common SSO protocols: **LDAP, OAuth, SAML**

---

## One-Line Memory Aid

**“SSO = authenticate once at the IdP, access everything.”**
