# Access Control Models – Exam Summary

## What Is Access Control?

Access control defines **who can access what** and **under what conditions**.
It protects systems, data, and resources from unauthorized use.

---

## The 5 Primary Access Control Models (MEMORIZE)

Use the mnemonic:
**M-D-R-R-A** → *Mandatory, Discretionary, Role, Rule, Attribute*

---

## 1. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

**Highest security model**

* Access controlled by a **central authority**
* Uses **security labels** (clearance levels)
* Users **cannot change permissions**
* Anything not explicitly allowed is **denied**

📌 Example:

* Military classifications (Unclassified → Confidential → Secret → Top Secret)

📌 Exam keywords:

* Security labels
* Clearance levels
* Central authority
* High security environments

---

## 2. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

**Owner controls access**

* Resource owner decides **who gets access**
* Based on **user identity**
* Often used for file sharing
* Less secure than MAC

📌 Example:

* Sharing a folder with specific users

📌 Exam keywords:

* Owner decides
* Identity-based
* Need-to-know

---

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Most common in enterprises**

* Users assigned to **roles or groups**
* Permissions assigned to roles, not users
* Easy to manage
* Ideal for organizations with high turnover

📌 Example:

* HR group, Accounting group, Employees group

📌 Exam keywords:

* Groups
* Job functions
* Organizational roles
* Least privilege enforcement

⚠️ Note:

* **RBAC = Role-Based**, not Rule-Based

---

## 4. Rule-Based Access Control

**Access based on system rules**

* Administrators define rules
* Applies to **all users**
* Rules can change frequently

📌 Example:

* Firewall rules
* Router ACLs

📌 Exam keywords:

* Rules
* Policies
* Network-wide enforcement

---

## 5. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

**Most flexible and granular**

* Access based on **attributes**
* Evaluates multiple conditions

### Types of Attributes:

* **User**: role, ID, clearance
* **Resource**: sensitivity, owner
* **Environment**: time, location, threat level

📌 Example:

* SharePoint showing different content per user

📌 Exam keywords:

* Dynamic access
* Context-aware
* Attribute evaluation

---

## Additional Access Control Concepts

---

## Time-of-Day Restrictions

* Limits access based on **time**
* Used with other models
* Helps reduce insider threats

📌 Example:

* Access allowed only 8 AM – 6 PM

---

## Principle of Least Privilege

**Core security principle**

* Users get **only the access needed** to do their job
* Nothing more

📌 Benefits:

* Reduces damage from mistakes
* Limits impact of compromised accounts

📌 Example:

* Read-only database access if write access isn’t required

---

## Permission (Authorization) Creep

* Users accumulate permissions over time
* Occurs during promotions or job changes
* Violates least privilege

📌 Solution:

* **Regular permission reviews**
* Remove old role permissions

## Quick Comparison Table

| Model      | Who Controls Access | Best Use Case                 |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| MAC        | Central authority   | Military / government         |
| DAC        | Resource owner      | File sharing                  |
| RBAC       | Roles / groups      | Enterprise networks           |
| Rule-Based | Admin rules         | Firewalls / ACLs              |
| ABAC       | Attributes          | Complex, dynamic environments |

## Final Exam Takeaways

* MAC = highest security
* RBAC = most common
* ABAC = most flexible
