# Access Control & Permissions – Exam Summary

## What Is Access Control?

**Access control** determines **who can access what** on a computer system and **what actions they can perform**.

* Users prove identity through **authentication**
* Permissions define **allowed actions**
* Goal: **Protect system integrity and data**

📌 *Exam mindset:* Authentication = **who you are**
Authorization = **what you can do**

## User Accounts (Hotel Key Analogy)

| Computer Concept | Hotel Example             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| System           | Hotel                     |
| User account     | Key card                  |
| Authentication   | Showing the key           |
| Permissions      | Which rooms you can enter |

Each user has a **unique account** with specific permissions.

## Types of User Accounts

### 1. Local Administrator Account

* Created during OS installation
* **Highest level of access**
* Can:

  * Install software
  * Change system settings
  * Manage other accounts

⚠️ Too much power for daily use

---

### 2. Standard User Account

* Designed for everyday tasks
* Can:

  * Run applications
  * Save files in user folders
* Cannot:

  * Change system settings
  * Install system-wide software

📌 *Best practice:* Use standard accounts daily

---

### 3. Microsoft Account

* Online account used across devices
* Can sign into:

  * Windows
  * Office 365
  * Xbox
  * Skype
* Syncs settings, files, and preferences

📌 Can replace local accounts if configured

---

## Principle of Least Privilege (VERY IMPORTANT)

**Users should only have the minimum access required to do their job—nothing more.**

* Reduces damage from:

  * Mistakes
  * Malware
  * Compromised accounts

📌 *Exam phrase:*

> “Always give less than necessary.”

---

## User Account Control (UAC)

### What Is UAC?

A **security feature in Windows** that:

* Requires approval for admin-level actions
* Helps enforce least privilege

### How It Works

* Prompts for:

  * Admin password, or
  * Confirmation (Yes/No)
* Triggered when:

  * Installing software
  * Changing system settings

📌 Shield icon = UAC prompt required

---

## Groups and Permissions

### User Groups

* Users can belong to groups like:

  * Administrators
  * Standard Users
* Users **inherit group permissions**

📌 Easier to manage permissions at group level

---

## File & Folder Permissions

### What Can Be Controlled

* Read
* Write
* Execute
* Full control

### Where to Configure (Windows)

* Right-click file/folder → Properties
* Security tab

### Permission Scope

* File-level permissions
* Folder-level permissions (apply to all files inside)

📌 Folder permissions = inherited by contents

---

## Best Practices (Exam Gold)

✔ Use **standard accounts** for daily work
✔ Use **admin accounts only when needed**
✔ Enable **UAC**
✔ Apply **least privilege** everywhere
✔ Assign permissions cautiously

📌 Better to grant **too little** than **too much**

---

## One-Line Memory Aid

**“Authenticate the user, authorize the minimum.”**

---

## Final Exam Takeaway

* Access control protects system integrity
* Permissions define allowed actions
* Least privilege is the core security principle
* UAC enforces admin approval
* Groups simplify permission management
