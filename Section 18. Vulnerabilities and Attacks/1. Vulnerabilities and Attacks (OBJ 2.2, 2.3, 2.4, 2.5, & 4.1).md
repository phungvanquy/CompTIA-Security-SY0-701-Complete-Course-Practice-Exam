# Vulnerabilities & Attacks – Exam Preparation Summary

## Key Definitions (EXAM FOUNDATIONS)

### Vulnerability

A **weakness or flaw** in:

* Hardware
* Software
* Configuration
* Process

📌 Can lead to **unauthorized access, data breaches, system disruption**

---

### Attack

A **deliberate action** by a threat actor to **exploit a vulnerability**.

Examples:

* Malware
* Data theft
* Denial of Service (DoS)
* Social engineering
* Unauthorized access

📌 Attacks target **CIA triad**:

* **Confidentiality**
* **Integrity**
* **Availability**

---

## Exam Domains Covered

This section focuses on:

* **Domain 2**: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
* **Domain 4**: Secure Systems and Applications

### Exam Objectives

You must be able to:

* **2.2** – Explain threat vectors and attack strategies
* **2.3** – Explain types of vulnerabilities
* **2.4** – Analyze indicators of malicious activity
* **2.5** – Explain mitigation techniques
* **4.1** – Apply security techniques to systems

---

## 1. Hardware Vulnerabilities

Applies to:

* Servers
* PCs / laptops
* Network devices (routers, switches)
* Mobile devices
* IoT

### Common Hardware Vulnerabilities

* Outdated firmware
* End-of-life or unsupported systems
* Missing patches
* Misconfigurations

### Mitigations

* Patch management
* System hardening
* Baseline configurations
* Decommission old devices
* Network isolation / segmentation

---

## 2. Bluetooth Vulnerabilities & Attacks

Bluetooth attacks to **memorize for the exam**:

* **Bluesnarfing** – Stealing data
* **Bluejacking** – Sending unsolicited messages
* **Bluebugging** – Full device control
* **Bluesmack** – Bluetooth DoS
* **BlueBorne** – Remote code execution

📌 Bluetooth = **short-range ≠ safe**

---

## 3. Mobile Vulnerabilities

### Common Mobile Risks

* Side loading apps
* Jailbreaking / rooting
* Connecting to unknown Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices

### Mitigations

* Patch management
* Mobile Device Management (MDM)
* Disable side loading
* Prevent rooting/jailbreaking

---

## 4. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

### Zero-Day Definition

A vulnerability:

* **Unknown to the vendor**
* **No patch exists**
* Actively exploited

📌 Extremely dangerous
📌 Once public → **no longer zero-day**

---

## 5. Operating System Vulnerabilities

### Common OS Issues

* Unpatched systems
* Zero-day exploits
* Misconfigurations
* Data exfiltration
* Malicious updates

### Mitigations

* Regular patching
* Configuration management
* Encryption (data at rest)
* Endpoint protection
* Host-based firewall & IPS
* Access controls & permissions
* Application allow-listing

---

## 6. Injection Attacks

### SQL Injection

* Malicious SQL input
* Manipulates database queries
* Can expose or modify data

### XML (XPath) Injection

* Targets XML parsers
* Manipulates XML input
* Can cause data exposure or unauthorized access

📌 Injection = **untrusted input executed as code**

---

## 7. Web Application Attacks

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* Injects malicious scripts into webpages
* Affects users viewing the page

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF)

* Tricks users into performing actions
* Exploits trusted user sessions

📌 XSS = script injection
📌 CSRF = forced actions

---

## 8. Buffer Overflows

### Definition

Occurs when:

* More data is written to memory than allocated

### Impact

* Program crashes
* Arbitrary code execution

📌 Classic memory-based vulnerability

---

## 9. Race Conditions

### Definition

Occurs when:

* Multiple processes access shared resources simultaneously
* Execution order causes unintended behavior

### Key Terms

* **TOC** – Time of Check
* **TOU** – Time of Use
* **TOCTOU** – Time of Check to Time of Use vulnerability

---

## Easy Memory Framework (EXAM HACK)

**H-B-M-Z-O-I-W-B-R**

* **H**ardware
* **B**luetooth
* **M**obile
* **Z**ero-day
* **O**S vulnerabilities
* **I**njections
* **W**eb attacks
* **B**uffer overflows
* **R**ace conditions

---

## Final Exam Takeaways

* Vulnerabilities = weaknesses
* Attacks = exploitation
* Zero-days = most dangerous
* Input validation is critical
* Patch early, patch often
* Segmentation and hardening reduce risk
