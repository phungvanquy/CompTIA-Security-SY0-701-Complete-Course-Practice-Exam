# Operating System Vulnerabilities – Exam Summary

Operating systems (OSs) are critical because they connect **hardware and software**.
If the OS is vulnerable, **everything on the system is at risk**.

For the exam, focus on **five major OS vulnerabilities** and how to **mitigate** them.

---

## 1. Unpatched Systems

**Outdated operating systems without security updates**

### Why it’s dangerous

* Known vulnerabilities already have **known exploits**
* Attackers actively target unpatched systems

### Mitigation

* Apply **regular security patches**
* Enable **automatic updates**
* Periodically verify patch status

📌 *Exam tip:* Unpatched systems = **known vulnerabilities + known exploits**

---

## 2. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

**Previously unknown vulnerabilities with no available patch**

### Why it’s dangerous

* Developers have **“zero days”** to fix it
* No official patch exists yet

### Mitigation

* Host-based **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**
* Defense in depth
* Regular system and software updates
* Strong security monitoring

📌 *Exam tip:* Zero-day ≠ unpatchable forever, but requires **behavior-based detection**

---

## 3. Misconfigurations

**Incorrect or insecure OS settings**

### Common causes

* Default settings left unchanged
* Unnecessary services enabled
* Security features disabled

### Mitigation

* Configuration management tools
* Standardized system builds
* Regular configuration audits and reviews

📌 *Exam tip:* Misconfigurations are often caused by **human error**

---

## 4. Data Exfiltration

**Unauthorized transfer of data out of the system**

### How it happens

* OS vulnerabilities exploited
* Malware silently steals data

### Mitigation

* Encrypt data **at rest**
* Endpoint protection tools
* Host-based firewalls (control inbound/outbound traffic)
* Monitoring for unusual data transfers

📌 *Exam tip:* Encryption protects data **even if it’s stolen**

---

## 5. Malicious Updates

**Fake or compromised updates containing malware**

### Why it’s dangerous

* Appears legitimate
* Exploits user trust

### Mitigation

* Download updates **only from trusted vendors**
* Verify updates using **digital signatures or hashes**
* Application allow listing

📌 *Exam tip:* Not all updates are safe — verify authenticity

---

## Defense-in-Depth Summary

Most OS vulnerabilities can be mitigated with **basic security hygiene**:

* Patch regularly
* Use encryption
* Apply configuration management
* Monitor systems
* Verify updates

## Easy Memory Trick (5 OS Vulnerabilities)

**U-Z-M-D-M**

1. **U**npatched systems
2. **Z**ero-day vulnerabilities
3. **M**isconfigurations
4. **D**ata exfiltration
5. **M**alicious updates

---

## Final Exam Takeaway

* OS vulnerabilities affect **entire systems**
* Many attacks succeed due to **poor maintenance**, not advanced hacking
* Simple controls + layered defenses greatly reduce risk
