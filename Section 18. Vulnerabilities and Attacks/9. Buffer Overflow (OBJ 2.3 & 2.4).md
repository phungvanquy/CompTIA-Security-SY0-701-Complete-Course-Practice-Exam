# Buffer Overflow – Exam Summary

## What Is a Buffer Overflow?

A **buffer overflow** occurs when a program **stores more data in a memory buffer than it was allocated to hold**.

📌 Result: Extra data **overwrites adjacent memory**, which attackers can exploit.

---

## What Is a Buffer?

* A **buffer** is a **temporary storage area in memory**
* It has a **fixed size** determined by the developer

**Simple analogy:**

* Buffer = glass
* Data = water
* Too much data = overflow and mess

---

## Why Buffer Overflows Are Dangerous

* Overwritten memory may include **control data**
* Attackers can:

  * Redirect program execution
  * Run **malicious code**
  * Gain **remote code execution (RCE)**

📌 Buffer overflows are a **common initial attack vector**

---

## How a Buffer Overflow Attack Works (Conceptually)

1. Program allocates a fixed-size buffer
2. Input is **larger than expected**
3. Extra data spills into adjacent memory
4. Critical values (like return addresses) get overwritten
5. Program executes **attacker-controlled code**

---

## The Stack (Important Exam Concept)

* The **stack** is a reserved memory area used by programs
* Stores:

  * Function data
  * **Return addresses**
* Uses **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order

📌 Buffer overflows often target the **stack**

---

## Smashing the Stack

**Smashing the stack** occurs when:

* An attacker overwrites the **return address**
* Program execution jumps to **malicious code**

### NOP Slide

* Attacker fills memory with **NOP (No Operation) instructions**
* Execution “slides” through NOPs
* Eventually reaches malicious payload

📌 Purpose: Increase chances the return address lands in attacker code

---

## What Attackers Gain

* Shell or command prompt access
* Ability to run commands remotely
* Full compromise of the system

---

## Buffer Overflow Mitigation

### ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)

* Randomizes memory locations
* Makes return addresses **unpredictable**
* Prevents easy exploitation

📌 Introduced in **Windows Vista**

⚠️ ASLR can be bypassed, but it still raises attack difficulty

## What You Need to Know for the Exam

✔ A buffer overflow:

* Puts **too much data into memory**
* Overwrites adjacent memory
* Can allow **malicious code execution**

✔ Common targets:

* Stack
* Return addresses

✔ Key terms:

* Buffer
* Stack
* Smashing the stack
* NOP slide
* ASLR

---

## One-Line Memory Trick

**“Overflow the buffer → overwrite memory → run attacker code.”**

---

## Final Exam Takeaway

Buffer overflow attacks exploit **poor input handling** and **fixed-size memory buffers** to redirect program execution and run malicious code. Defensive techniques like **ASLR** reduce—but do not eliminate—the risk.
