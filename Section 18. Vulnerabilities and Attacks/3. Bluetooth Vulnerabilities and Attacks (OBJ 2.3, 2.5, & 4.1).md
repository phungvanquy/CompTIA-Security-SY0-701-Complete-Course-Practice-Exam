# Bluetooth Vulnerabilities & Attacks – Exam Summary

## What is Bluetooth?

* Short-range **wireless communication technology**
* Used to connect devices **without Internet**
* Common in phones, laptops, cars, headsets, IoT devices

📌 *Exam focus:* Convenience **vs** security risk

---

## 1. Bluetooth Vulnerabilities

### Insecure Pairing

* Weak or no authentication during pairing
* Allows unauthorized access

### Device Spoofing

* Attacker impersonates a trusted device
* Mimics device name or MAC address

### On-Path (Man-in-the-Middle) Attacks

* Attacker intercepts and modifies Bluetooth traffic
* Users are unaware of eavesdropping

📌 *Exam tip:* Weak pairing = biggest Bluetooth weakness

---

## 2. Common Bluetooth Attacks (MEMORIZE “BLUE” ATTACKS)

### Bluejacking

* Sends **unsolicited messages**
* Usually harmless, prank-style

### Bluesnarfing

* **Steals data** (contacts, messages, call logs)

### Bluebugging

* **Takes control** of device functions
* Can make calls, send texts, access internet

### Bluesmack

* **Denial of Service (DoS)**
* Floods device causing crash or freeze

### Blueborne

* **Worm-like attack**
* Spreads over Bluetooth without user interaction
* Highly dangerous

📌 *Exam mnemonic:*
**Jack (message) → Snarf (steal) → Bug (control) → Smack (DoS) → Borne (spread)**

## 3. Bluetooth Security Best Practices

### Disable Bluetooth When Not in Use

* Reduces attack surface

### Set Devices to Non-Discoverable

* Prevents unknown devices from seeing you

### Keep Firmware Updated

* Patches known Bluetooth vulnerabilities

### Pair Only with Trusted Devices

* Avoid unknown or public connections

### Use Strong, Unique PINs or Passkeys

* Protects pairing process

### Reject Unsolicited Requests

* Files or connection requests may contain malware

### Use Encryption for Sensitive Data

* Protects data if intercepted

📌 *Exam tip:* Non-discoverable + updates + encryption = strong defense

---

## Key Exam Takeaways

* Bluetooth is **convenient but risky**
* Main vulnerabilities:

  * Insecure pairing
  * Device spoofing
  * On-path attacks
* Common attacks start with **“Blue”**
* Security relies on **user behavior + configuration**

---

## One-Line Memory Aid

**“Bluetooth attacks are BLUE, pairing must be secure, and discoverability must be OFF.”**
