# Hardware Vulnerabilities – Exam Summary

## What Are Hardware Vulnerabilities?

**Hardware vulnerabilities** are weaknesses in a device’s **physical components, firmware, or configuration** that can be exploited to impact:

* **Confidentiality**
* **Integrity**
* **Availability**

They affect **all device types**, including:

* Servers, workstations, laptops
* Routers, switches, firewalls
* Mobile devices
* IoT devices

---

## Common Types of Hardware Vulnerabilities (MEMORIZE THESE)

### 1. Firmware Vulnerabilities

**Firmware** = low-level software controlling hardware

**Why dangerous:**

* Runs with **high privileges**
* Can allow **full device takeover**
* Often overlooked during updates

**Causes:**

* Insecure design
* Outdated firmware
* Missed updates

**Mitigation:**

* Regular firmware updates
* Security audits
* Device hardening

📌 *Exam tip:* Firmware attacks are **high impact**

---

### 2. End-of-Life (EOL), Legacy & Unsupported Systems

These terms are often used **interchangeably**.

* **End-of-Life (EOL):** No more vendor updates
* **Legacy:** Outdated but still in use
* **Unsupported:** No patches or technical support

**Risk:**

* Known vulnerabilities remain **unpatched**
* Easy targets for attackers

📌 *Exam tip:* No updates = high risk

---

### 3. Unpatched Systems

Devices or software missing the **latest security updates**

**Causes:**

* Oversight
* Poor patch management
* Deployment challenges

**Risks:**

* Exploitation of known vulnerabilities
* Data compromise
* Service disruption

**Mitigation:**

* Patch management program
* Timely update deployment
* Monitoring for new patches

---

### 4. Hardware Misconfigurations

Incorrect or insecure device settings

**Causes:**

* Human error
* Lack of best practices
* Poor configuration standards

**Risks:**

* Open security holes
* Unauthorized access
* Reduced performance

**Mitigation:**

* Configuration audits
* Secure configuration baselines
* Automated detection tools
* Staff training

---

## Mitigation Techniques (VERY EXAM-IMPORTANT)

Use the mnemonic **H-P-C-D-I-S**

---

### 1. Hardening

* Disable unnecessary services
* Close unused ports
* Apply least privilege
* Secure firmware and hardware settings

---

### 2. Patching

* Regular updates for:

  * Firmware
  * OS
  * Applications

---

### 3. Configuration Enforcement

* Standardized secure configurations
* Prevents misconfigurations
* Uses policies and automation

---

### 4. Decommissioning

* Remove EOL or legacy systems
* Best option when security risk is too high

📌 *Exam tip:* **Best solution for EOL systems**

---

### 5. Isolation

* Separate vulnerable systems from core network
* Limits potential damage if compromised

---

### 6. Segmentation

* Divide network into zones
* Prevents lateral movement
* Contains breaches

---

## Final Exam Takeaways

* Hardware vulnerabilities are **not just physical**
* Firmware is a **high-value attack target**
* EOL and unsupported systems should be **removed or isolated**
* Patch management and configuration control are critical
* Segmentation limits breach impact
