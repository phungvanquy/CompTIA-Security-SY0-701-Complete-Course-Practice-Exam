# Mobile Vulnerabilities & Attacks – Exam Summary

Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, wearables) are powerful and convenient, but they introduce **significant security risks**. To protect them, you must understand **key vulnerabilities** and how **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** mitigates those risks.

---

## 1. Sideloading

**Installing apps from unofficial sources**

### Why it’s dangerous:

* Bypasses official app store security checks
* Apps are not verified or scanned
* High risk of malware and spyware

### Mitigation:

* Only install apps from **official app stores**
* Disable sideloading when possible

📌 *Exam tip:* Sideloading = **malware risk**

---

## 2. Jailbreaking & Rooting

**Removing built-in security restrictions**

* **Jailbreaking** → iOS devices
* **Rooting** → Android devices

### Why it’s dangerous:

* Disables manufacturer security controls
* Prevents automatic security updates
* Increases exposure to exploits and malware

### Mitigation:

* Do **not** jailbreak or root devices
* Keep default security settings enabled

📌 *Exam tip:* Jailbroken/rooted devices are **less secure and unpatchable**

---

## 3. Insecure Connection Methods

Mobile devices rely heavily on **wireless connectivity**, which increases risk.

### High-risk connections:

* Open or unsecured Wi-Fi networks
* Unknown Bluetooth devices
* Discoverable Bluetooth mode

### Threats:

* Eavesdropping
* On-path (MITM) attacks
* Unauthorized data access

### Mitigation:

* Prefer **cellular data** over public Wi-Fi
* Use secured Wi-Fi (strong passwords or **802.1X**)
* Pair Bluetooth only with trusted devices
* Disable Bluetooth discoverability when not pairing

📌 *Exam tip:* Open Wi-Fi + Bluetooth = **attack surface**

---

## 4. Mobile Device Management (MDM)

**Centralized security control for mobile devices**

### Key Functions of MDM:

* **Patching**: Pushes OS and security updates
* **Configuration management**: Enforces security baselines
* **Policy enforcement**:

  * Disable sideloading
  * Detect jailbroken/rooted devices
  * Force VPN usage
  * Enforce encryption and screen locks

### Benefits:

* Reduces mobile attack surface
* Ensures compliance with security standards
* Centralized control for enterprise devices

📌 *Exam tip:* MDM = **risk reduction + policy enforcement**

---

## Quick Memory Aid (S-J-I-M)

1. **S**ideloading – unofficial apps = malware
2. **J**ailbreaking / Rooting – removes protections
3. **I**nsecure connections – Wi-Fi & Bluetooth risks
4. **M**DM – centralized protection and enforcement

---

## Key Exam Takeaways

* Mobile convenience increases security risk
* Sideloading and jailbreaking/rooting weaken device security
* Wireless connections are common attack vectors
* MDM is the **primary defense** in enterprise environments

---

### One-Line Exam Summary:

**Mobile security risks come from sideloading, jailbreaking/rooting, and insecure wireless connections—and MDM is used to mitigate these risks through patching, configuration, and policy enforcement.**
