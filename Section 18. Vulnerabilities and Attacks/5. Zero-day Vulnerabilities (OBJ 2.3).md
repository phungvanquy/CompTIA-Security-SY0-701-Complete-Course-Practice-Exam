# Zero-Day Vulnerabilities & Exploits – Exam Summary

## What Does “Zero-Day” Mean?

**Zero-day** means the vulnerability is exploited **before the vendor knows it exists** and **before a patch is available**.

📌 *“Zero days of warning for the defender.”*

---

## Key Definitions (VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAM)

### Zero-Day Vulnerability

* A **previously unknown flaw** in software or hardware
* The vendor is **unaware**
* No patch or fix exists yet

📌 Example:
A flaw in Windows that Microsoft does not know about

---

### Zero-Day Exploit

* The **attack or technique** that takes advantage of a zero-day vulnerability
* Created by a threat actor

📌 Vulnerability = weakness
📌 Exploit = weapon used against the weakness

---

### Zero-Day Attack / Malware

* Malware that **uses a zero-day exploit**
* Often what exam questions refer to when they say “zero-day”

⚠️ On the exam, **“zero-day” may refer to**:

* The vulnerability
* The exploit
* The malware
  ➡️ **Read the question carefully**

---

## Why Zero-Days Are So Dangerous

* No patch exists
* Antivirus signatures do not exist
* Traditional defenses cannot detect it
* Can be exploited for:

  * Days
  * Weeks
  * Years

📌 *This makes zero-days extremely destructive*

---

## Detection & Prevention Reality

❌ Traditional antivirus:

* Relies on known signatures
* **Cannot detect zero-day exploits**

✅ What still helps:

* Up-to-date antivirus (blocks known attacks first)
* Defense-in-depth
* Monitoring and anomaly detection
* Patch management (once fix is released)

---

## Zero-Days as a Business

* Very expensive to develop
* Can be worth:

  * Thousands
  * Hundreds of thousands
  * Even **millions of dollars**

### Who buys zero-days?

* Software vendors (bug bounty programs)
* Governments
* Intelligence agencies
* Law enforcement
* Criminals (dark web)

---

## How Threat Actors Use Zero-Days

1. **Try known vulnerabilities first**

   * Cheap
   * Easy
   * Detected by antivirus
2. **If that fails → use zero-day**

   * Saved for **high-value targets**
   * Governments, corporations, espionage

📌 Zero-days are **not usually wasted on random users**

---

## Nation-State Use

* Stockpile zero-days
* Use for:

  * Espionage
  * Surveillance
  * Strategic cyber operations

---

## Exam-Focused Key Points to Remember

* Zero-day = unknown to vendor
* Zero-day exploit = attack using that vulnerability
* No patch exists at time of attack
* Antivirus cannot detect it initially
* Often used only for high-value targets
* Can remain hidden for a long time

---

## One-Sentence Exam Answer Template

> “A zero-day vulnerability is an unknown software flaw exploited before a vendor can release a patch, making it extremely dangerous and undetectable by traditional antivirus solutions.”
